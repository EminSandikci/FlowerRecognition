# Image Classification using Python and Deep Learning

This repo contains the code to perform a simple image classification task using Python and Deep Learning. We will apply global feature descriptors such as Color Histograms.


## Summary of the project

For now the app can determine only 5 flowers.We will update when we find more flowers datasets.


## Technologies we used

Project has two stages;
First one is model of the flower recognition.We used Python and Tensorflow there.
Second one is App's texture and the rest.We used TensorflowHub and Android Studio there.
